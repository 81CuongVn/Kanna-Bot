## Setup
It's pretty straight forward to use the bot.
You must have the necessary permissions to invite discord bots.

This bot requires `Administrator` permissions on your server.

Follow this link to invite the bot:

[Invite Kanna Bot to your Server!](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=450118801816551424&permissions=8&scope=bot) 

or, if the above link doesn't work

https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=450118801816551424&permissions=8&scope=bot

### Requirements
There are a certain requirements you must have on your server to ensure an enhanced experience with the bot
1. Create a role solely dedicated to the bot (Ex: Bots) and give it the `Administrator` role
2. Keep no restrictions for the bot
3. Create a `#textchannel` called `reports` for the report command to work
4. Create a `#textchannel` called `incidents` for the kick/ban command to work
